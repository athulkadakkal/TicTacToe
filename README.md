# Tic Tac Toe Game 

## Introduction
Tic Tac Toe is a classic, simple game typically played by two players. One player uses the 'X' marker, and the other uses 'O'. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing their markers. The objective is to be the first player to align three of their markers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Due to its straightforward rules and quick gameplay, Tic Tac Toe is a popular game among all age groups.

## Rules of the Game
1. **Game Setup:** The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player chooses a marker ('X' or 'O'). Players decide who goes first, often through a random selection.

2. **Playing the Game:**
   - Players take turns placing their chosen marker in an empty cell within the grid.
   - The first player to start the game uses 'X', while the second player uses 'O'.

3. **Objective:** The main goal is to get three of your markers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

4. **Winning the Game:** As soon as a player aligns three of their markers in a row, the game ends, and that player is declared the winner.

5. **Draw or Tie:** If all nine cells are filled and no player has three markers in a row, the game is considered a draw or a tie.

6. **Game Reset:** Once a game concludes, whether by a win or a draw, players can choose to play again by resetting the board.

These simple rules make Tic Tac Toe an easy game to pick up and play, making it an enduring favorite for quick and fun challenges.
